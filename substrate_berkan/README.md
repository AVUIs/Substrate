The physics.jar in here is a slightly updated version of the Trear Physics library - a very simple hack that adds a generic property object to the Particle class:

Particle.properties is a HashMap<String,Object> , with all that affords.


Replace your physics.jar in your $SKETCHBOOKFOLDER/libraries with this one to run the code.
