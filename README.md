# Substrate

From group Five

* [berkan](github.com/berkan)
* [lpil](github.com/lpil)
* [zipporobotics](github.com/zipporobotics)

## Goals

* Simple to use
* Generate audio
* Generate visuals
* Flexible
* Single screen
* Interactive

### Libraries:

Place library in `~/sketchbook/libraries`

* Traer Physics 
  * http://murderandcreate.com/physics/
* oscP5
  * http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/

### Crash course on Processing

* https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/3/f/e/3/Processing_Cheatsheet_Update.pdf
* http://assets.surattack.com/files/processing_cheat_sheet_english.pdf

## Sprint 1

Tools:

* Processing
* Git 
* An audio server recieving OSC commands from visual app

Ideas:

* Particle based system
* Particles can be interacted with by touch
  * Tap and drag
  * Repulsion
  * Attraction
* Controls
  * Multi finger touches
  * Button zones (can be hidden)


## Pitch

Its an audiovisual substrate that allow you to jam with particles on a
touchscreen and generate messagges that will be sent to a sound engine.

### Task 1

* Setup the environments 
* Download the libraries

### Task 2

Demo the particle library so every one understand how it works
Setup particles generator

### Task 3

Setup the messagess using Processing OSC 
Let's set it up to send 

* particle coordinates
* velocity
* if something else come up we do.
