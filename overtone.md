# Overtone

Using Overtone means that we will have problems with audio setup on Linux. This
is because Supercollider only supports JACK on Linux, and typically you will
use JACK with an external audio interface, rather than fight with the system
audio over the intergrated audio interface.

Do we have cards for everyone to use?
